## 🎯 Publishing Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Package Name

You have **two options**:

#### Option A: Scoped Package (Professional - Recommended)
```json
"name": "@digitalfutures/vscode-setup-check"
```
- **Command students run:** `npx @digitalfutures/vscode-setup-check`
- **Requires:** npm organization `@digitalfutures` 
- **Pros:** Professional, clear ownership, namespaced
- **Check if org exists:** https://www.npmjs.com/org/digitalfutures

#### Option B: Unscoped Package (Simpler - No Org Required)
```json
"name": "ocadu-vscode-setup"
```
- **Command students run:** `npx ocadu-vscode-setup`
- **Requires:** Nothing - works immediately
- **Pros:** No organization needed, shorter command
- **Cons:** Name might be taken

**Current package.json uses Option A** (`@digitalfutures/vscode-setup-check`)

---

### Step 2: Login to npm

Open terminal and login:

```bash
npm login
```

Enter your npm credentials when prompted.

Verify you're logged in:

```bash
npm whoami
```

---

### Step 3: Publish!

Navigate to the package directory:

```bash
cd /Users/npmac/Documents/GitHub/vsCodeSetup/vscode-setup-check
```

#### If using Option A (Scoped - Current Setup):

First check if `@digitalfutures` organization exists:
- Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/digitalfutures/packages
- If it doesn't exist, either:
  - Create the organization on npm.com, OR
  - Switch to Option B (see below)

Then publish:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

#### If using Option B (Unscoped):

First, update `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "ocadu-vscode-setup",
  "bin": {
    "ocadu-vscode-setup": "./index.js"
  }
}
```

Then publish:

```bash
npm publish
```

---

### Step 4: Test It!

After publishing, test that students can run it:

```bash
# For Option A:
npx @digitalfutures/vscode-setup-check

# For Option B:
npx ocadu-vscode-setup
```

This command:
- Downloads the package from npm (no installation)
- Runs the verification script
- Shows students their setup status

---

## 🔄 Updating After Publishing

When you make changes to the script:

```bash
cd /Users/npmac/Documents/GitHub/vsCodeSetup/vscode-setup-check

# Make your code changes...

# Bump the version
npm version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
# or
npm version minor  # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
# or
npm version major  # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0

# Publish the update
npm publish

# Commit the version change
cd ..
git add vscode-setup-check/package.json
git commit -m "Bump package version to $(cat vscode-setup-check/package.json | grep version | cut -d'"' -f4)"
git push
```

Students automatically get the latest version when they run `npx`!

---

## 📝 After Publishing - Tell Students

Update your course materials with:

### For Option A (Scoped):
```bash
npx @digitalfutures/vscode-setup-check
```

### For Option B (Unscoped):
```bash
npx ocadu-vscode-setup
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Publishing

### "You do not have permission to publish"
**Solution:** Use `npm publish --access public` for scoped packages

### "You must be logged in"
**Solution:** Run `npm login` first

### "Package name already taken"
**Solution:** Choose a different name or add your username: `@yourusername/vscode-setup-check`

### "@digitalfutures organization doesn't exist"
**Options:**
1. Create it at: https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
2. Switch to unscoped name (Option B above)
3. Use your personal scope: `@yourusername/vscode-setup-check`
